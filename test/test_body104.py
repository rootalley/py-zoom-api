    Zoom API

    The Zoom API allows developers to safely and securely access information from Zoom. You can use this API to build private services or public applications on the [Zoom App Marketplace](http://marketplace.zoom.us). To learn how to get your credentials and create private/public applications, read our [Authorization Guide](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/guides/authorization/credentials). All endpoints are available via `https` and are located at `api.zoom.us/v2/`.  For instance you can list all users on an account via `https://api.zoom.us/v2/users/`.  # noqa: E501
